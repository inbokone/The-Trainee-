1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
Are we interning or working at a printing house?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,340
What are we even learning from this?

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,680
The costume got a green light.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,064
That Assistant Director Jane is also really strict.

5
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:10,914
He’s annoying.

6
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,304
He’s strict with you all too, isn’t he?

7
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:18,264
(Cannot Send Message. You’re temporarily blocked from the conversation.)

8
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,664
That extra I found blocked me.

9
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,064
He cheated me out of money and blocked me.

10
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:25,974
We can find someone else. Why are you crying?

11
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:28,484
I’ll take responsibility by resigning.

12
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:31,944
The printer has been fixed now.

13
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:34,234
It’s fixed and ready for printing.

14
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:39,104
Hey, are you open to an extra job?

15
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,784
Actually, you’re not a bad assistant.

16
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:46,964
If you still want to come back tomorrow, I’ll see you at the office.

17
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,024
We leave the office at 5:30 a.m.

18
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:58,634
Ryan. Ryan.

19
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:02,094
Ryan!

20
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:05,154
Why didn’t you answer the radio?

21
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,874
Why didn’t you answer the radio?!!

22
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:13,814
Why didn’t you answer the radio?!!

23
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:15,794
Why didn’t you answer the radio?!!

24
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,574
Why didn’t you answer the radio?!!

25
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:21,174
Why didn’t you answer the radio?!!

26
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:40,534
Why didn’t you answer the radio?!!

27
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,374
If you still want to come back tomorrow, I’ll see you at the office.

28
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:56,584
We leave the office at 5:30 a.m.

29
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:57,764
5:30 a.m.

30
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,954
5:30 a.m.

31
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:00,154
Damn!!

32
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:15,464
You told me it’d take 2 days but it has been 3.

33
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,994
This is such a scam!

34
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,884
Sir, you just sent me the file yesterday evening.

35
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:22,564
Not even a day passed.

36
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:25,564
And, please, if you want to complain, check the time.

37
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:26,814
It’s just 5:00 a.m.!

38
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,364
The shop hasn’t opened yet!

39
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,344
I don’t care.

40
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:33,654
I sent you a message last night that I’d pick up my work at 5:00 a.m.

41
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,414
What, Ryan?

42
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:36,654
Have you seen my phone?

43
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:38,414
- Can’t you see that I’m busy? - Where is it?

44
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,744
We’ll see.

45
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:44,454
If the work didn’t come out well, would you have time to fix it?

46
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:46,614
Not even sure if the color will be nice.

47
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,774
I should have gone to other shops.

48
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,674
And you work slowly.

49
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:53,774
Will you make it on time?

50
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:56,964
You didn’t make it. They just left 10 minutes ago.

51
00:02:56,984 --> 00:03:00,204
They left at 5:30 a.m. sharp. Didn’t they tell you?

52
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:04,024
I woke up late but, never mind, I’ll call my friend.

53
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,854
(Nong Ink’s Printing)

54
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,854
Damn it!

55
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,494
Why weren’t you careful?

56
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:19,204
How could you take the shop’s phone?

57
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,764
I was in a rush. Thought it was mine so I took it.

58
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:24,884
Didn’t you plan to resign?

59
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,374
Skip it, Ink. Stop asking now.

60
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,974
Fine, fine. Use the shop’s phone for the time being then.

61
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:32,254
I’ll contact customers via the computer instead.

62
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,434
So, you’ll catch up with the crew?

63
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,554
Yeah. I was late for 10 minutes.

64
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,974
Might make it on time. The appointment is at 6:00 a.m.

65
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:40,644
Let’s talk later, Ink. I’ll call a cab.

66
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:42,314
Okay, okay.

67
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:55,294
(EP 3: THE GROWN-UP BATTLEFIELD)

68
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,084
It’ll charge my card.

69
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,004
Okay.

70
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:10,984
Get out of my way.

71
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:28,974
This will be here and that should be there.

72
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:33,034
Ball! Ball! Can we make it clearer?

73
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:33,954
Like…

74
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:36,674
Did you assign someone to Unit B for me?

75
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:37,864
Will ask the intern to do it.

76
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:38,654
They’re fine.

77
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:39,614
Okay.

78
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,734
Jane, let some interns help me outside.

79
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:45,774
They’re taking care of the actors.

80
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,174
I’ll let Prang help you then.

81
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,504
Okay. Tell him to follow me.

82
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:52,654
What a day!!

83
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,884
What time did I tell you that we’d leave?

84
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:00,644
5:30 a.m.

85
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,434
Then, when did you arrive at the office?

86
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:05,724
I was there after you left for 10 minutes.

87
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:07,244
No matter how many minutes it was, you were late.

88
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:08,464
Even “10 minutes” is late.

89
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:09,314
Put your bag away.

90
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:11,074
Prang! Give him a walkie-talkie.

91
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:12,724
Will be easier when we call him for help.

92
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:14,434
And be on standby at the set.

93
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,414
You help Lamyai outside, Prang.

94
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,294
Well…

95
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,364
Hey,

96
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:24,794
keep your phone silent at the set.

97
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:29,914
How can I turn it off?

98
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,794
Where should I press?

99
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:39,624
Are you good with this frame?

100
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:42,054
There’s also another size that is more narrow

101
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,454
and can highlight motherhood even more.

102
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:46,844
(Arrived at the office? I’m SO BORED.)

103
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,164
(Finish the sandwiches I made for you, too.)

104
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:51,794
Ba-Mhee.

105
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:53,914
Don’t use your phone while meeting with the clients.

106
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,614
(Okay. I’ll work now.) - Do you want some tea or coffee?

107
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:07,324
(Judy is so dramatic.)

108
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,274
(Not sure if she trains me to be AE or servant.)

109
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,114
(Need to take care of everything.)

112
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,914
I’ll radio you when I need any of the extras.

113
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:43,304
Do you know how to use this?

114
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,974
Press this button and speak.

115
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,344
You guys please wait here.

116
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:16,574
Don’t walk around.

117
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:19,624
If you want to go to the toilet, inform my team first.

118
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:37,464
Kiddo, I’ll buy a coffee for a moment.

119
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,024
Well…

120
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,714
The shop is next to the studio. Not going to be a problem.

121
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,984
In front of…

122
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:49,654
Please come back quickly.

123
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:58,184
I’ve not seen Ja today.

124
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,264
She’s not here?

125
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:02,934
Oh, I saw her next door. She’s working there.

126
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:05,694
Heard that the costume team didn’t get to sleep last night.

127
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:10,104
The one that the clients wanted to change the costume before the shooting date?

128
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:12,934
Yes. The client is one thing

129
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:14,684
but it’s more about the assistant…

130
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,714
They just agreed with whatever the clients requested.

131
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:20,264
Didn’t care if our team could handle it or not.

132
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:22,574
Oh, that’s right. I agree.

133
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:27,324
(Pie, if the makeup is done, take the actor to the set right away.)

134
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:31,614
Handsome.

135
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:36,364
How many minutes till it’s done?

136
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,864
Wait a moment.

137
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:44,794
How many minutes is “a moment”?

138
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:46,614
I’ll tell the team precisely.

139
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,404
You’ll see when we’re done.

140
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,084
Look up, please.

141
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,564
As scheduled, we need the actor by 9:00 a.m. and it is now 9:00 a.m.

142
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:05,024
We told you to wait, so you wait. Give us some time.

143
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:09,214
They spare time for camera settings but not for dressing up.

144
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:24,264
Just like this.

145
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,884
(Okay. Got it, Jane.)

146
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:29,174
The actor is here.

147
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,454
Okay. Please wait here.

148
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,274
Take the aunty extra here.

149
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:38,254
March, reset this for me.

150
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:50,874
The aunty hasn’t come back?

151
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:54,244
Yes. She went to buy a coffee but I’ve not seen her back here.

152
00:10:56,894 --> 00:11:00,724
What? How could you let the extra go out to buy coffee?

153
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,334
She told me she’d go to the shop next door.

154
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:05,394
But I told you they have to be on standby here.

155
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,614
Can’t you do this easy task?

156
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:16,364
Tie your shoelace. You need to be agile.

157
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:27,774
Go to the set now.

158
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:41,464
I’ll warn you to keep your phone silent one last time.

159
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:53,784
Cut!

160
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:58,514
Change the dollying setup to hero landing now.
(SETUP: the camera placement for shooting each shot.)

161
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:10,414
How was it? As scheduled?

162
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,474
You dream it. Today is full of issues.

163
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:13,754
Is that side okay?

164
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,944
It was fine before I left. The team is diligent.

165
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:20,744
You assigned the interns to take care of the Unit B on my behalf,

166
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:21,904
will that be alright?

167
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,764
Should be fine. Let them try.

168
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,114
It makes sense for you to help me here.

169
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:26,444
Did you give the walkie-talkie to your team?

170
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:27,324
Yeah.

171
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,634
Okay. Put on the green screen.

172
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:34,434
1 Kaphrao with squid, please.

173
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,264
We’ve run out of squid.

174
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:40,014
No squid? Then, how can you find ink for printing?

175
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:47,294
Don’t you need to record the voice, too?

176
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:49,494
No. I just have to move the pan.

177
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:51,004
This will appear on the client’s monitor.

178
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:54,264
If we record the sound, too, there’ll be only his voice.

179
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:05,264
Pah, add some bell peppers to make it more colorful.

180
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,654
So, it’ll look appetizing.

181
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:07,944
Fine.

182
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:11,964
Yellow and…

183
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:15,624
How is it?

184
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:24,364
Well, I don’t want the food to be flipped so high.

185
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:27,944
Want it to be like when Mom cooks at home.

186
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:29,134
Got it.

187
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:32,384
Unit B, the food shouldn’t go that high.

188
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:34,834
Make it like when Mom cooks at home.

189
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:57,094
Oho! You’re good, too.

190
00:13:57,774 --> 00:14:01,404
Nice! If there are any small motion projects, I’ll assign them to you.

191
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:04,664
But, today, try rendering some works first.

192
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:06,014
Okay?

193
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,134
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:09,034
Just ask me if you have any questions.

195
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:21,644
(I told you to respond to me within 30 minutes.)

196
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,444
(Your girlfriend is so lonely.)

197
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,114
(She needs company.)

198
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:38,994
(Will I get my work today?)

199
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:40,674
(If I don’t have my work today, I’ll whine for real.)

200
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:43,014
(Why should I waste my time waiting for you?)

201
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,344
(Quickly answer me.)

202
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,084
Intern, what is my queue?

203
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:48,794
I’m going to smoke outside for a moment.

204
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:57,084
They’re changing the scene.

205
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,414
I’ll check with them when they’re back.

206
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:02,644
Don’t tell me you will make me wait until lunch.

207
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:05,874
He doesn’t know anything.

208
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,534
(You rejected my call again.)

209
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:13,744
(Will I get the vinyl banners today?)

210
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:20,534
Guys, please wait here.

211
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:21,654
Don’t walk around.

212
00:15:21,674 --> 00:15:23,934
The Assistant Director might need you for the shot.

213
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:31,064
Ink, clients have sent lots of complaints.

214
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:32,674
Don’t you need to say sorry to them?

215
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:34,834
Though I say sorry, they don’t stop complaining.

216
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,364
So silly.

217
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:39,764
Just give in. It’s not good to be scolded.

218
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:41,344
Then you scold them back!

219
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:44,324
You are not wrong, why do you allow them to scold you?

220
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:49,734
The set will be ready to shoot in 5 minutes.

221
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:52,354
Ink, let’s stop talking.

222
00:15:52,374 --> 00:15:54,384
I called to tell you that I’d turn the phone off.

223
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:55,854
Fine, fine! Just turn it off.

224
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:57,594
I’ll check the message on the computer.

225
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:09,574
Take an aunty extra here, please.

226
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:13,824
Why didn’t you answer the radio?

227
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:20,374
Where is the extra?

228
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,594
Did my team allow you to go out?

229
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,894
I told him I’ll smoke outside for a moment.

230
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,894
But did he allow you to go?

231
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:42,724
He didn’t say anything.

232
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:46,704
So, you allowed her to do so?

233
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,534
If staff tell you to be on standby, you need to do so.

234
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,864
You cannot do just whatever you want.

235
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:58,964
This kid doesn’t communicate well.

236
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,584
He just started working and you let him order me, the elder?

237
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,594
Isn’t it weird?

238
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:09,034
At least, the kid is doing what he’s been assigned.

239
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:12,424
The elder should have done it, too.

240
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:18,124
If you still want this job, then go to the set.

241
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,674
But if you don’t want to do it anymore, you can go home right now.

242
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,764
I’ll inform the modeling.

243
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:28,944
You can just tell me nicely…

244
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,944
Try to speak up next time.

245
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:39,184
If they don’t listen, then you make them do it.

246
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:41,724
Though you’re an intern, you have a say.

247
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:42,984
Understand?

248
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,664
Ryan.

249
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:54,264
Here’s the masking tapes. Don’t ask for them again.

250
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,624
Thank you.

251
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:03,094
I want to visit the main set, too.

252
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,594
There’s nothing in the Unit B.

253
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:09,414
I got to do more when I joined the set with our seniors in uni.

254
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:16,574
Ryan, come to see me at the set once you’re done eating.

255
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:19,004
Yes, sir!

256
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,854
Throw them away for me.

257
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:32,064
My walkie-talkie isn’t off. Why doesn’t anyone call for me?

258
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:39,074
Even borrowing a camera is hard,

259
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,434
how could I find a place for an internship in production?

260
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:43,584
But you’re not bad, Pah.

261
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:47,014
If you secured some opportunities, I think you could grow further.

262
00:19:47,724 --> 00:19:49,264
I don’t know.

263
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,884
Or should I do some casting instead? Just be an actor.

264
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:53,954
He wants to be an actor.

265
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:56,234
You need to be as handsome as me first.

266
00:19:56,744 --> 00:19:58,414
He changed his mind to acting.

267
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:00,874
Pie! Let’s eat these mangosteens together!

268
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,544
Uncle Moo brought so many for us.

269
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:12,474
You’re Pah’s friend, are you from Khonkean, too?

270
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:14,284
I’m from Bangkok.

271
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:17,464
She graduated from the same faculty as Baimon.

272
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,014
You were in the same major, right?

273
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:24,314
Oho! So, you must be smart as you get into a famous university.

274
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,414
That’s dope!

275
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,564
Why didn’t you study medicine?

276
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:29,214
If I were good at studying,

277
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:31,094
my mom would force me to be a doctor for sure.

278
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:33,444
If the only professions for smart people were doctors,

279
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:35,464
the world would be overflowing with them.

280
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:44,324
Pie produced some short films for competition.

281
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,904
She got lots of awards.

282
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,934
Hey, you are talented!

283
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:50,034
Pah, you should follow your friends.

284
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,824
Why keep playing games?

285
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:53,624
If we were all good just like her,

286
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:55,604
then the world would be overflowing with directors!

287
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:57,024
What a sarcasm.

288
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,724
No, I mean if you like something,

289
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,314
then you should pay attention and do it right.

290
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,534
Just like your friend.

291
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,154
Though she’s not a doctor, she’s brilliant in her way.

292
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:06,924
I’ll share this with you.

293
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:09,174
I used to work with one female director.

294
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:10,854
The work was so dope.

295
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,004
She is…

296
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:12,924
What’s her name?

297
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:13,984
It’s Cherry!

298
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,294
Yes. Do you know her?

299
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:20,804
How can you not know her?

300
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:29,864
You can lightly do it like this,

301
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:32,584
but it will dirty your hands.

302
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,464
If you don’t want to mess up your hands,

303
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:37,184
then use a knife.

304
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:42,884
Here.

305
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:47,494
You’re clever!

306
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:50,814
I even fail to peel oranges.

307
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:53,194
We’re all good at different things.

308
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:54,954
If we were all good at peeling mangosteens,

309
00:21:54,974 --> 00:21:56,864
then we wouldn’t get to eat something else.

310
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:59,284
But I don’t know how to peel other fruit either.

311
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,834
But you got awards from the short film competitions.

312
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,554
I cannot do that.

313
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:06,204
How do you know you cannot do it?

314
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,114
You haven’t tried once.

315
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,914
Not bad for the first try.

316
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,364
(ROLLING: The camera is recording.) Rolling.

317
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:36,154
Moment, please.

318
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:37,744
Hurry up.

319
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,274
Okay. Let’s continue.

320
00:22:44,004 --> 00:22:47,744
Okay then focus on a stir-fried vegetable.

321
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:54,654
Nice. Cut!

322
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,709
Okay, Pie.

323
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,130
Passed.

324
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,820
Okay. Wrap the Unit B. Thank you. (WRAP: a filling is done.)

325
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,380
Goodbye.

326
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,870
I didn’t forget you. You’re just too far.

327
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,160
Ba-Mhee, we’ve run out of drinks.

328
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,300
If the support team comes here, I’ll tell them.

329
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,670
Looknam and Jeab, do you want any drinks or snacks?

330
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,030
I’m going to the support team.

331
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,400
So, bring these drinks to the second floor now. Clients are waiting.

332
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,460
If you also have some snacks, bring them there, too.

333
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:07,880
Okay.

334
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,270
Bring them there right away.

335
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,050
I’ll do it.

336
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,680
Why do you have to do it yourself?

337
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,220
The clients didn’t ask for anything.

338
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,330
It doesn’t matter if they need anything

339
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,100
but we always have to be ready.

340
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Aren’t we making them ads, Judy?

341
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,100
Why do we have to focus on these minor things?

342
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,500
The minor things you mentioned might be the determining factor

343
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,350
of what time everyone gets to go home.

344
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,280
The AE's responsibility is to take good care of clients for the team’s interests.

345
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,420
If you think that an AE

346
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,970
only can just be pretty in front of the monitor,

347
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,950
I don’t think you got it right.

348
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,060
I want you to adjust your mindset.

349
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,250
Moves this way a bit. Just a bit.

350
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,070
Okay.

351
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,370
Just a bit! A little. Okay, there.

352
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,950
Mark it.

353
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,570
Bring the actors here now.

354
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,100
Roger that.

355
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,830
Girl, my part is done. I can leave now, right?

356
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,000
Moment, please. I’ll check for you.

357
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,620
You’re the aunty extra, right?

358
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,700
Yes.

359
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,320
This is the real prop.

360
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,500
Prang, do we shoot as scheduled?

361
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,480
Yes, yes. Likely to be faster than expected.

362
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,710
If it is smooth like this, we should be able to finish early.

363
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,650
Stop. Don’t say this word.

364
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,330
It’s a forbidden one.

365
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,740
So?

366
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,080
Your part is done. You can go home now.

367
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,340
Come this way, please.

368
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,540
Better be on this side.

369
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,300
Move a bit. Yes, pretend to stir the pot.

370
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,790
Yeah, just like that. Keep going.

371
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,340
These kids, though they look timid, work pretty fine.

372
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,730
After finishing this shot, we’ll reshoot the morning’s shot.

373
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,640
There will be an office guy and aunty extra.

374
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,880
Ryan, prepare them.

375
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,450
Yes, Jane.

376
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,340
Saw she left for quite a while.

377
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,330
She said her part was done.

378
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,950
Did you let her go home?

379
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,290
I didn’t. I told her to wait.

380
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,490
Then, who let the extra go home?

381
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,880
Who’s that?

382
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,070
Won’t we finish as scheduled? I haven’t slept.

383
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,370
Been pulling an all-nighter for days.

384
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,870
Okay but can you come here faster?

385
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,870
I’m also not sure when we will finish.

386
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,010
Then, you can just come now.

387
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,170
What do you think?

388
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,020
I think it’ll take ages.

389
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,590
I have to work early tomorrow.

390
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,570
She’s almost home. The van is going to pick her up.

391
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,510
Damn. Did anyone say that the shooting will be smooth?

392
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,850
Why are there lots of problems?

393
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,120
Jane, there’ll be lots of OT to pay.

394
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,380
I’m gonna be scolded to death.

395
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,990
Okay. There is one shot we can shoot first

396
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,300
but it will show a glimpse of the hair.

397
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,670
Do we have anyone with similar hair to the extra?

398
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,680
Oh, not at all. We only have male extras here.

399
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,000
What should we do?

400
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,770
A close-up shot doesn't show the face, right?

401
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,720
Yes. Only the hair appears there, not the face.

402
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:13,560
I’m not sure if it’ll work but the one from a support service team…

403
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,090
Yes?

404
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,370
Slowly. Keep stirring.

405
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,060
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

406
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,180
Okay. Cut! Passed!

407
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,850
Cut 4. Take 3.

408
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,440
Does it work?

409
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,340
You should be the main actress.

410
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,250
Fine. I still have some luck.

411
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,740
Change the setup, please.

412
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,720
It’s funny, right?

413
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,540
We somehow get to do the service part.

414
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,040
How can it be funny?

415
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,200
We need to do it because she is on the set.

416
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,620
I’m sorry.

417
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,690
Why do you have to be sorry?

418
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,770
Can’t you stop making me feel worse?

419
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,580
All the staff wasted their time because of me.

420
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,570
Why must it be me who made the mistake?

421
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,410
But you let the extra go according to the plan.

422
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:45,060
Only the fool won’t recheck with the Assistant Director first.

423
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,180
Why didn’t I ask Jane?

424
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,720
I could have done it.

425
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,260
But, Jane is so not approachable.

426
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,180
For the whole day today, I’ve done nothing substantial.

427
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,330
As if they don’t take interns like us seriously.

428
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,160
You see?

429
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,720
I’ve wronged them so much and still bad-mouthed them…

430
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,640
Why am I like this?

431
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,720
I’m suck at being an assistant and peeling mangosteens.

432
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,030
Cut!

433
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,620
Is it okay, Baimon?

434
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,010
Baimon approved.

435
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,540
Okay, the client approved the shot.

436
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Okay. Approved.

437
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,990
It’s a wrap for today.

438
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,830
Isn’t it too late?

439
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,200
I think it’s 2-3 hours late.

440
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,490
Regarding the extra issue today, I’m truly sorry.

441
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,230
Then, let me say it frankly.

442
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,610
I’m so shocked that this kind of incident happened.

443
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,450
I’ve worked with my housing agencies

444
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,400
but never faced such silly issues.

445
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,250
If we get to work together next time,

446
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,710
I hope it’ll never happen again.

447
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,220
I have no excuses.

448
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,140
We miscommunicated and it’s my responsibility.

449
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,720
I’m truly sorry.

450
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,800
It’ll not happen again.

451
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,950
Alright then.

452
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,970
Thank you. I’ll send you off.

453
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,760
I’m sorry!

454
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,190
Sorry, guys!

455
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,500
I’m sorry!

456
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,640
Will you and Pie go to apologize to Jane?

457
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,330
I feel guilty for you.

458
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,690
What’s wrong with your phone?

459
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,870
I took the wrong one.

460
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,240
This is my shop’s phone and I cannot turn it on now.

461
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,600
Here.

462
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,010
Thank you.

463
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,460
Hello. Hello, Ink. This is An.

464
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,760
The shooting is over but the phone is dead.

465
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,880
I cannot turn it on. Maybe it’s out of battery.

466
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,330
Fine. Don’t mind it.

467
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,000
No need to check the messages.

468
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,880
I got back on all of them wickedly.

469
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,580
I’m going back now.

470
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,430
Thank you.

471
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,570
If you want to ask me something, then ask.

472
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,490
I have no answer for you if you just look at me like that.

473
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,780
What kind of person can be hurt by the first-aid kit?

474
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,130
Stay still. Leave it to me.

475
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,570
Will you take it off?

476
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,430
It’s okay. I’m not hurt.

477
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,390
I mean the masking tape on your shoes.

478
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,270
Or you’ll take it off at home?

479
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,210
Well, will you be in trouble because of what happened today?

480
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,070
Nah. Just be scolded.

481
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,430
Why? Do I look like someone who has never been scolded?

482
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,850
Not that.

483
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,850
But you could tell them that it was the intern who let the extra leave.

484
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,210
Nobody cares who did it.

485
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,750
We only need someone there to be scolded.

486
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,290
Whether it’s me or you guys who did it,

487
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,820
it doesn’t matter.

488
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,480
I thought the grown-ups wouldn't be scolded.

489
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,730
But you didn’t have to apologize, right?

490
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,040
If saying sorry allows 50 people to go home, then you just do it.

491
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,670
One day, if I make a mistake with you,

492
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,130
I have to apologize to you, too.

493
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,350
Age doesn’t matter.

494
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,960
Anyway, if you can protect yourself from being scolded, that’s great.

495
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,020
Such as…

496
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,310
how to tie shoelaces tightly on YouTube.

497
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,600
I’ve figured out who Ryan Giggs is.

498
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,440
And am I right?

499
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,320
Today, you assisted me as well.

500
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,740
Managing to find an extra for me.

501
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,870
I think that Ryan is way more superior than me.

502
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,230
Then, which Ryan do you want to be?

503
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,750
I want to be James Ryan.

504
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,610
Saving Private Ryan?

505
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,030
Why?

506
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,640
This morning,

507
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:40,170
when I entered the studio, it was like a battlefield.

508
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,220
Everyone was loud and fought

509
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,390
but we all had the same goal.

510
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:51,970
I was an underling and you came to rescue me.

511
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,420
I do my job.

512
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,540
John Miller also does his job to bring Ryan back home.

513
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,950
Ryan also has his job, guarding the bridge.

514
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,240
Did you really finish the film?

515
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,500
Thank you.

516
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,620
(I’m sorry. I'll hurry it up for you.)

517
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,310
(I’m sorry again. I’ll give you a 5% discount.)

518
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:23,140
(I’m sorry, sir. Could you please send the file again?)

519
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,360
(Thank you for your understanding. I’ll hurry it up and finish it by tomorrow.)

520
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,600
Is it urgent work?

521
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,340
The one of that uncle.

522
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,490
He misunderstood the date and blamed it on me.

523
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,070
If I don’t do it for him, he’ll complain!

524
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,610
I have to welcome my son who just finished his military service.

525
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,260
There’ll be a feast.

526
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,460
Not only that,

527
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,900
he also boasted that his son passed the civil service exam.

528
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,390
Do I have to know that?

529
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,240
Which ministry?

530
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,200
I didn’t listen carefully. What ministry again?

531
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,470
Public Health?

532
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,840
(Ryan after work.)

533
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,210
(5 Interns, Class of 24) (Pie, are you okay?)

534
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,150
(It’s okay, Pie.)

535
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,710
(Pie, actually, I think…)

536
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,590
(Sorry for disturbing you guys.)

537
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,510
(But I’m curious.)

538
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,920
(Why did we need the Unit B today?)

539
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,300
(Couldn’t we shoot everything at the main set?)

540
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,800
(You’re so diligent. Not even taking rest.)

541
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,860
(I just unpacked things at the office.)

542
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,830
(Tae sent me home. He just went back.)

543
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,720
(Almost home.)

544
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,850
(I think we have the Unit B to support some tasks from the main set.)

545
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:05,900
(In case there are too many shots to shoot within the given period.)

546
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,750
(For example, you look at this storyboard.)

547
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,690
There are lots of shots, right?

548
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,180
If we have only 1 unit, we won’t make it on time.

549
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,480
Like this shot, it’s a close-up shot, so we can shoot it elsewhere.

550
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,490
So, we need a few people

551
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,520
but can finish all required shots on time.

552
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,640
(Oh, I got it.)

553
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,890
(And, are you okay, Pie?)

554
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,740
(Good night, everyone.)

555
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,410
(Go rest.)

556
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,740
(Okay.)

557
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,670
(Dream of me @Tae.)

558
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,130
(Shouldn’t you chat privately? I’m blushing.)

559
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,540
(Awkward smile.)

560
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,120
I dared to say so because I might not be here anymore.

561
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,060
I was called to talk about yesterday’s incident.

562
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,460
You’re talented. I want us to work here together.

563
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,480
Did anyone from the Editing team bring me a hard disk?

564
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,790
The one with No.2 in the top right corner.

565
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,270
Did you take the medicine?

566
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,450
I need to bring a hard disk to the director team.

567
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,320
Just going to sip some water, will that break your hard disk?

568
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,640
- Hurry up! Come with me! - Wait, Mhee.

569
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,970
If you don’t have it now, then…
